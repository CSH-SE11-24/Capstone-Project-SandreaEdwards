This project is a Demo of my feature, the "Emotional Assessment Quiz". This is made for the Hiveclass team and their website. First, you'll start on the home page and at the top you'll see an alert that asks you to take an emotional assessment quiz with a link; click the link. You will be taken to a page that will ask you a series of questions, which include your unit, lesson, grade, and day progression. Then you will be able to choose, via dropdown, what emotions you are currently feeling. Once you choose an emotion, you can choose a workout category and by hovering over "see workouts" you'll see your recommended workout.
